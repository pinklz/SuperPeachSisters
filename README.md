UCLA CS32 Winter 2022: Super Peach Sisters - This project was completed by February 27, 2022

I implemented the Actor and StudentWorld classes for the assignment's provided game structure. Peach begins each game with three lives and 
can continue completing levels until she wins or has lost all three lives. The StudentWorld class constructs each level and deals
with level progression based on the number of lives Peach has left. Each actor has their own respective movement patterns and
responses to interacting with Peach, who is controlled by the user.
